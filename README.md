## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) installed on your system.

### Installation

Clone the repo:

```bash
gh repo clone bLangved/Noroff-teacher-rotation-app
```

Install and setup project-dependencies:

```bash
npm i
```

### Running the Project

**Do not use live-server.**
The project is configured to run with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/). When running Vite, SCSS watcher gets started automaticly. 
You'll get both a local server, and a networked hosted server. For checking the project on other devices, use the network server. 

Run the Vite server with the following command.

```bash
npm run dev
```

To build the project, run the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will create a `dist` folder in the root of the project, which contains the compiled project.
